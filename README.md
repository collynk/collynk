Design Approach
I broke the project into essential components and focused on how each object would fit together.
By iterating on textures and lighting, I ensured that objects blended seamlessly into the scene while keeping the design visually strong yet efficient.

Development Approach
I used modular coding to allow flexibility and frequent iteration. Each milestone built on the last, reinforcing how small adjustments in textures or lighting affect the overall scene realism. This taught me to balance performance vs. detail for functional, realistic environments.

Computer Science Goals
This project strengthened my knowledge of 3D graphics and visualization, which supports career goals in areas like gaming and simulations.
Skills in texture management, lighting, and scene layout are directly applicable to professional roles involving 3D environments and visualization.

ðŸŽ“ Academic Context

This project was created as part of the SNHU Computer Science program (CS 330 â€“ Computational Graphics and Visualization).
It demonstrates:

3D modeling and rendering.

Iterative development with modular design.

Application of computer science to graphics and simulation.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

Add animation and interactivity.

Expand scene complexity with additional objects.

Experiment with advanced lighting/shader techniques.

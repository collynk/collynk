CS 330 - 3D Scene Project: Gaming Desk Scene
Artifacts
I’m submitting the 3D Scene ZIP folder and Design Decisions document as artifacts showcasing my skills in creating a 3D gaming desk setup, complete with a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other desk items.

Reflection
How do I approach designing software?
When designing, I break projects down into essential parts and think about how they’ll fit together. For this project, I focused on realism with efficient use of textures and lighting to keep it simple yet visually strong. Each object was an iteration, where I adjusted details and ensured they blended well in the scene. This structured approach will definitely help in future visual projects.

How do I approach developing programs?
My development strategy included modular coding for flexibility and frequent iteration to refine textures and lighting. Each milestone built on the last, teaching me how small changes impact the entire scene. Over time, I’ve learned to balance detail with performance, focusing on what’s essential to make the scene realistic and functional.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This project deepened my understanding of 3D graphics, which supports my CS goals, especially in areas like gaming and simulations. The skills I gained in texture management, lighting, and scene layout are directly applicable to roles that require visualization, helping me bridge academic learning with future professional projects.
